// There are 3 relevant lengths for the space image:
//   1. the "screen size", which is the size of the cropped space image before rendering on the screen;
//   2. the "entity position size", which indicates where entities can be on the space image. It has an extra buffer
//      around the screen size in every four direction so that entities can smoothly 'appear' on screen from every direction;
//   3. the "background total size", which must accomodate drawing enitities at any possible position,
//      and hence must have an extra buffer around the max position size (2.) bottom and right.
